# History 
\
Bon Om Touk’s traditions date back to the 12th-century, during the reign of King Jayavarman VII, originally honoring naval strength and prosperity. 

\
The festival celebrates the reversal of the Tonle Sap River’s current, which plays an important role in the nation’s agriculture and fishing.

\
Bon Om Touk is also a thanksgiving to Preah Mae Kongkea, the river goddess, for blessings of water, fish, fertile land, and prosperity. Her devotees pray for peace, compassion, and abundant harvests.
