# Traditions 
\
Bon Om Touk has many traditions and practices, including boat races and lanterns.

\
On day one, the festival kicks off with boat races on the Tonle Sap River in Phnom Penh. The boats are dragon-shaped and brightly painted, made to represent Cambodian villages, organizations, and government ministries. After sunset, the Bandaet Pratip, decorated boats from various ministries, float down the river glowing with thousands of colorful lights. This, along with fireworks, symbolizes the end of the day.

\
On day two, offerings of fruits, coconuts, and special rice called Ambok are placed in front of homes in order to receive the moonâ€™s blessings. The Og Ambok ceremony involves family gatherings at pagodas to dance, lighting lanterns, and praying to Preah Purthisat. Families also play games, with losers often eating Ambok with bananas the entire day.

Finally on day three, a ceremonial ribbon is cut, marking the end of both the boat races and the festival.
