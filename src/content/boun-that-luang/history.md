# History 
\
The festival is linked to a Buddhist story, and is symbolic of Lao identity and spirituality. That Luang is often remembered for its traditional music, dancing, candlelight processions, fairs, and chanting.

According to legend, the “wax castle” procession originated when a pregnant woman, Nang Si, threw herself to death under a pillar as it was being placed in position. Today, this pillar is located at the Vientiane temple, where groups gather for worship during That Luang. Nang Si is now seen as the guardian of the city, with people honoring her and Buddha during the festival.
