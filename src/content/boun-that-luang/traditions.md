# Traditions

Many people make offerings of food, candles, incense, and flowers while participating in a procession of “wax castles.”

\
One celebration, known as taak baat, is also an important part of That Luang. Crowds gather at dawn to give gifts to hundreds of monks and honor the stupa. Many people come as early as 5 AM to secure good spots for preparing their offerings.

The game of tikhy, played with a ball and long curved sticks, is an important part of Lao tradition. After praying and enjoying a delicious meal, people gather to watch a lighthearted game of tikhy between the two teams of the Vientiane municipality.

The festival ends on the full moon, when Laos residents gather for a final candlelight procession. The night concludes with fireworks, as people attend trade fairs and concerts for the last day of the festival.
