# Food 
\
Beyond ancestral traditions, food is an important aspect of Chuseok. The most popular dishes include jeon and songpyeon.

Jeon is a battered and pan-fried Korean pancake filled with meat, seafood, and vegetables. It is representative of the bountiful harvest and is often cooked to honor ancestors during rites.

Songpyeon is a half-moon shaped rice cake made with harvested rice and designed to honor the moon. Family members often make the dish together as a way to express gratitude for the yearâ€™s bounty. It is often said that making pretty songpyeon will lead to a good marriage and beautiful children.
