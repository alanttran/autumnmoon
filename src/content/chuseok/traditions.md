# Traditions 
\
On the morning of Chuseok, families honor their ancestors with memorial services, such as charye. Families set their tables with abundant amounts of fruit and rice, hoping that their ancestors will provide them a successful harvest. Other Chuseok traditions are seongmyo and beolcho, where families visit, clean the graves of loved ones, and tidy surrounding areas.

Traditional games and dances, such as ganggangsullae, a circle dance performed under the full moon, and ssireum, Korean wrestling, are also enjoyed as part of the festivities. Communities often come together to share food, celebrate the harvest, and strengthen family and social bonds.
