# Traditions

On the morning of Chuseok, families honor their ancestors with memorial services, such as charye. Families set their tables with abundant amounts of fruit and rice, hoping that their ancestors will provide them a successful harvest. Another Chuseok tradition is seongmyo, where families visit and clean the graves of loved ones.Â
