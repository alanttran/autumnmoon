# Food

Food is an important part of Tết Trung Thu. Families gather together to eat mooncakes (Bánh Trung Thu), sesame rice balls (Dau Xahn Vung), summer rolls, fried spring rolls, various fruits, duck, and more.

After honoring the festival through worship, families enjoy evenings under the moon with mooncakes and tea. Children are often excited by this, eager to stay up past their bedtime.
