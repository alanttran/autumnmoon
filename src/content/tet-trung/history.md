Tết’s origin traces back to over 2000 years ago, as Vietnam adopted the celebration during Chinese Rule (111 BC to 939 AD). Over time, the festival evolved to reflect Vietnam’s cultural heritage and history.

The festival has many legends, but the most popular is about a man named Chu Cuoi. He was a woodcutter who discovered a magical banyan tree that could bring the dead back to life. After invaders killed Cuoi’s wife, he used the tree to save her. Unfortunately, due to memory loss, she accidentally used dirty water to wash her feet on the tree. After this, the tree began to fly towards the moon while Cuoi held on tightly. Today, people say they can see Cuoi and his tree on the moon during Tết Trung Thu.
