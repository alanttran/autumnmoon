Beyond popular tales, children celebrate the festival by parading through the street with colorful lanterns. These come in diverse shapes, such as stars, butterflies, and fish. The red star lantern is the emblem of the festival, meant to symbolize purity.

The celebration also includes a traditional lion dance, known as múa lân, where acrobatic dancers carry a lion to the beat of drums. A dancer wearing the mask of the Earth God, “Ong Dia,” also entertains the crowd.
