Thadingyut commemorates the Buddhaâ€™s descent from the celestial realm of Tavatimsa, where he had spent three months teaching the Dharma to his mother.

According to legend, his return to Earth was marked by three staircases made of gold, silver, and ruby, each symbolizing his divine journey. Each year, the event is honored with light displays representative of his return.
