# History 
\
Many scholars believe that Tsukimi spread to Japan through representatives from the Tang Dynasty during the Heian period (794-1185). Originally, the festival was only meant for royalty and aristocracy, celebrated in the form of luxurious parties and operas on boats. However, by the Edo period (1603-1868), the festival had become a celebration for all.

**Tsukimi is rich with folklore:**
* According to Japanese tales, a rabbit can be seen on the moon pounding mochi with a pestle. This originates from the belief that the dark spots on the moon are from the rabbit’s work. This story comes from a Buddhist tale where a rabbit sacrificed itself to feed a hungry god, who, in return, placed it on the moon. Many make offerings of dango to the moon rabbit, hoping for food fortune.
* Tsukuyomi, the moon god, is depicted as a serene deity, who enjoys the moon’s beauty. During Tsukimi, it is believed that his influence is felt as residents prepare rituals for moon-viewing events.
