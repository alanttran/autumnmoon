Moon-viewing is one of the most popular traditions of Tsukimi, where families gather in balconies and temples to admire the moon.

Usually, suski, a tall grass, is arranged to both ward off evil spirits from crops and honor the moon deity.Â Seasonal flowers, such as chrysanthemums and bellflowers, are also used in arrangements, representative of longevity and beauty.
