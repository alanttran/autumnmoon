The festival’s origins can be traced back to the Tang Dynasty (618-907 CE), with the first mention of the event found in the “Book of Rites,” a classic Confucian text written over 2400 years ago.

**The Mid-Autumn Festival is rich with folklore:**
* An archer named Hou Yi shot down nine surplus suns to protect the world from being scorched. As a reward, he was given a heavenly elixir, but his wife, Chang’e, drank it to protect him from a greedy apprentice. She became so light she floated to the moon, where she now resides as the Moon Festival Goddess. Hou Ui would prepare a feast for her every year, hoping to catch a glimpse of his wife’s shadow.
* The rabbit is a common mascot of the Mid-Autumn Festival, and symbolizes selflessness, piety, and sacrifice. In one tale, three immortals, disguised as beggars, asked three animals for food. The fox and monkey quickly provided food, but the rabbit did not have anything, and in turn, jumped into the fire as a sacrifice. Moved by her actions, the immortals sent her to live with Chang’e on the moon.
