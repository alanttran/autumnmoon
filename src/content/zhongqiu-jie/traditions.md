# Traditions 
\
The primary traditions of the Mid-Autumn Festival include family reunions, admiring the full moon, eating mooncakes, lanterns, and drinking Osmanthus wine.

**While these practices overlap across regions, many also have their own unique practices:**
* In Taiwan, families organize barbeques, offer moonflower cakes to land gods, and make special veggie cakes. 
* On the other hand, the Tai Heng Fire Dragon Dance is a notable tradition in Hong Kong. Dating back to 1880, it was originally a ritual to ward off the plague, but now showcases a dragon made of incense sticks and hemp rope.
